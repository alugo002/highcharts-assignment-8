  <h1>Is there a link between the percentage of GDP spent on R&D and energy supply?</h1>

    <p>The two charts below show data regarding the percentage of GDP spent on R&D,
      or research and development, in countries within North and Central America as
      well as the amoount of energy supply those countries had for the next two years
      per capita.</p>

      <p>Canada and the United States both had the highest expenditure on
      R&D and the highest energy supply per capita by far. However the most interesting
      revelation is the amount of energy supply in Canada compared to the United
      States. Despite the United States investing significantly more of its GDP into
      R&D, Canada had a slightly higher supply. The same can also be seen when comparing
      Panama's expenditure with that of Mexico and Costa Rica. Despite Mexico and
      Costa Rica putting more money into R&D, Panama had the same levels of energy
      supply as Costa Rica, which had a higher supply than Mexico even though Panama
      had put less money into R&D than both countries.</p>

      <p>The data shows that investment in R&D may not be the sole contributing factor in energy supply.</p>
